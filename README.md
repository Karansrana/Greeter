# Greeter

This is a simple Python script that greets the user by asking for their first name, last name, age, and favorite sport. Then it prints a personalized message.

## Example

What is your first name?

John

What is your last name?

Doe

Okay, what is your age?

20

Tell me one sport you love!

Football

## Output

So your name is John Doe, you are 20 years old and you like playing football.

### Note - variable.title is used to keep the name gramatically correct while variable.lower is used to keep the sport gramatically correct in the sentence in the event the user does not capatalize properly.

## Why this project?

This was my **first Python script**. I'm currently learning Python before college and using this to build foundational skills.

## How to run

- Clone the repo
- Run `greeter.py`
